macros:
  - name: union_source_tables
    description: >
      For *multiple-destination* users, This macro rolls log data up from 
      the destination level to the account level.

      It does so by taking a table name and scanning the source databases 
      (as declared in src_fivetran.yml) for relations matching this table name. 
      It then unions together these tables, capturing the individual database 
      it came from under `destination_database`. 
      
      Moreover, if you have never made a transformation, the `transformation`
      and `trigger_table` tables will not exist. In these cases, the macro 
      will return the proper columns with all null values.
    arguments:
      - name: table_name
        type: string
        description: The name of the table you want to union across destinations. 

  - name: handle_no_transformations
    description: >
      For *single-destination* users, this macro checks that a given table 
      actually exists in your source database. 
      
      It is intended to be used only for the `transformation` and `trigger_table` 
      tables. These are the only Fivetran Log tables that might not exist, as 
      they are only created once you have made a transformation in Fivetran.

      Thus, if no tables are found, the macro is hard-coded to create the 
      appropriate columns for `transformation` and `trigger_table` with all 
      null values. Otherwise, it simply selects * from the tables.
    arguments:
      - name: table_name
        type: string
        description: >
          The name of the table to check the database for ('transformation' or 'trigger_table').
  
  - name: string_agg
    description: > 
      A macro to concatenate strings across rows when writing to BigQuery, Redshift, 
      or Snowflake warehouses.
    arguments:
      - name: field_to_agg
        type: string
        description: The field you want to concatenate across rows.
      - name: delimiter
        type: string
        description: What you want to separate values by. 

  - name: type_string
    description: > 
      A macro to cast a value as a string across Redshift, Snowflake, and BigQuery
      warehouses. Adapted from the `dbt_utils.datatypes.type_string` macro, which 
      has some whitepace issues.

  - name: _get_utils_namespaces
    description: > 
      A macro used for compatibility across warehouses in the `type_string` and 
      `string_agg` macros. It returns the `dbt_utils_dispatch_list` variable, which 
      is then passed to `adapter.dispatch` as its `packages` argument.
