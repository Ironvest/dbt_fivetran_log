macros:
  - name: union_source_tables
    description: >
      This macro rolls log data up from the destination level to the account
      level. 

      It does so by taking a table name and scanning the source databases 
      (as declared in src_fivetran.yml) for relations matching this table name. 
      It then unions together these tables, capturing the individual database 
      it came from under `destination_database`. 
      
      Moreover, if you have never made a transformation, the `transformation`
      and `trigger_table` tables will not exist. In these cases, the macro 
      will return the proper columns with all null values.
    arguments:
      - name: table_name
        type: string
        description: The name of the table you want to union across destinations. 
  
  - name: string_agg
    description: > 
      A macro to concatenate strings across rows when writing to BigQuery, Redshift, 
      or Snowflake warehouses.
    arguments:
      - name: field_to_agg
        type: string
        description: The field you want to concatenate across rows.
      - name: delimiter
        type: string
        description: What you want to separate values by.
